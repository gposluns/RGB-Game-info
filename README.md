RGB-Game-info
=============

This is RGB Game, an old project of mine.

I created it while learning how to create Android Applications.  It's a simple puzzle game, but is not available on google play because I'm not satisfied with how it turned out gameplay-wise.

The apk here should still work though if anyone wants to see it, I can't upload the source files due to them being stored on an old laptop and usb that have since died.  They're not much to look at anyways, a lot of the code was written before I really knew what I was doing and it shows.

UPDATE:  I was able to retrieve a couple of files, though not the important ones.  One of those (GameFragment.java) was visible but corrupted, and the others were simply not present.
